I established the baseline of the system, just including the student table and login, logout function. Using redis to store session information. Next step would be think the architecture of the whole system strcutrely so that I'll feel more comfortable when adding new features.

I redesign the database schema so that I can develop the system more smoothly. Including considering some student that may have multiple departments (double major, minor, transfer history), so I add a new table to store the relationship between student and department.
The total system is relying on "user_id" as the primary key, so I use UUID to generate unique user_id for each user.

I finish the final DDL of the database schema, which clearly defines all the tables and their relationships. It's a huge step for the project.
