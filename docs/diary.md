I established the baseline of the system, just including the student table and login, logout function. Using redis to store session information. Next step would be think the architecture of the whole system strcutrely so that I'll feel more comfortable when adding new features.

[2025-11-05 11:19]
I redesign the database schema so that I can develop the system more smoothly. Including considering some student that may have multiple departments (double major, minor, transfer history), so I add a new table to store the relationship between student and department.
The total system is relying on "user_id" as the primary key, so I use UUID to generate unique user_id for each user.

[2025-11-05 12:06]
I finish the final DDL of the database schema, which clearly defines all the tables and their relationships. It's a huge step for the project.

[2025-11-05 12:13]
I create the tables with schema.sql file in the PostgreSQL database, besides, leave a instruction in note.md on how to create the database from schema.sql file.

[2025-11-05 14:51]
I combine the login and register function into one single auth module, which makes the code structure more clear and easier to maintain.
I try to establish a simple frontend web site(pure html), but the bridge between frontend and backend is not done yet.

[2025-11-19 15:24]
I need to redesign the development plan. The first step should be the cli interface not the web interface. Still, the socket for vue communication is needed, but the frontend would be design later.

This system would be built on docker to sync the development environment.

[2025-11-21 01:53]
I constructed the whole file structure for docker. But it just contains some folders and empty files now, just a skeleton structure.

Next step would be generate the ORM model files and establish the docker environment and make sure the backend can run inside the docker container.

[2025-11-21 16:18]
I tried to establish a simple register function, but there's lot of bugs to fix.

WTF a typing error waste me a half hour to fix. I just wrote "cofig.py" instead of "config.py". Such a silly mistake.

There's still some errors in the relation rules of the ORM model, need to fix them later.
The problem is, our relationships are too complex, and some relationships are many-to-many relationships, which makes the ORM model confusing. Thus, I decided to remove the relationship rules in the ORM model, just utilize SQL to handle the relationships.

This project is too complex with FastAPI. I decided to switch to NestJS for the backend. The old files are stored in the "backend_old" and compressed.

[2025-11-23 11:21]
Lyy finished a simple frontend interface of login and register, but she havn't connected the backend api yet. There's some error of the ports(the local psql and container's psql port are conflicted), so I changed the container's psql port to 6666, and redis port to 6667.

[2025-11-23 11:55]
Fix the env error of missing JWT_SECRET variable.

[2025-11-24 19:17]
I finish the connect between frontend and backend for the register function. The register function works well now. But I havn't finished the login function and JWT authentication yet.

[2025-11-24 19:53]
I put .env.local and .env.*.local into .gitignore so that my partners can't run the container smoothly. I commented these lines in .gitignore for now, but remember to uncomment them later.

[2025-11-24 23:56]
I wrote 7 hours today on this project. But there's still a lot of work to do. Next step would be finish the login function with JWT authentication. I have to spent more time on studying JWT.

[20285-11-25 22:43]
I've finished all the auth functions including register, login, logout and refresh token. The JWT authentication works well now. I utilize rotating refresh token strategy to enhance the security of the system. Besides, if frontend ask for a new access token, he sould also provide the expired access token and his refresh token to verify his identity.
Next step would be the student profile management functions.

[2025-11-26 10:18]
I decided to add 2FA function to enhance the security of the system. So I modified the user table to add otp_secret and is_2fa_enabled columns. The other function still needs more time to implement.

[2025-11-26 11:35]
There are several bugs after modifying the user entity. I fixed them one by one. I shouldn't push the temporary broken code to the main repository.

[2025-11-26 17:42]
I change the schema again, deleting the is_deleted boolean column and adding deleted_at timestamp column instead. This is more flexible for future use. If deleted_at is '9999-12-31 23:59:59', then the user is not deleted. Otherwise, the user is deleted. Besides, I'll design a function to automatically purge the deleted user after 1 year. This function would be placed at /modules/scheduler/tasks.

[2025-11-27 00:54]
I forgot to set JWT_SECRET in the generateToken function in auth.service.ts. This bug bothers me for several hours. Finally I found the problem and fixed it.
